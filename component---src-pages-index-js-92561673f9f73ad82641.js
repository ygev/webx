First is the book door, which the viewer will open and walk through into a canopy tent. Next the viewer will be engulfed in a space with lights and various green and blue fabrics surrounding them. While in this water world they will hear my voice reading book quotes and poems that feature watery scenes over top of ocean and rain sounds.

I had limited space so I decided to use a small canopy tent as the room and build a door for it that looks like a book. Next I had to think of what book and world my audience would be walking into. This was tough. There are just so many great books. So I came up with a theme instead and that was water. Water World would be a collection of poems and quoted book scenes having to do with water.\\n\\nI then broke up my weeks focusing on one section at a time. The inside of the tent was planned first, next the book door, then the outside of the tent. Each part was approached in a similar way. Researching and getting inspiration then sketching out ideas and making many lists. After gathering all the materials the building and setting up began.

Music is a method to express emotions and thoughts. The audience may or may not get the emotions lying in the music. However, when I listen to music, I tend to imagine the melody as space. Inside that space, every note turns into particles that fill this imaginary space with expressive colors and shapes. In my project, I wanted to visualize music to recreate the small universe I imagined while listening to the music. I took one clip from each of the two songs and tried to transfer the feelings from my motion graphics. The graphics in my videos represent the mood I felt in my perspective. The relaxing and lazy atmosphere is transformed into a soft, dreamy, dizzy, and retro grainy style. This is my understanding reacted to these two clips of music. Of course, different people would have a different experience when listening to the same pieces of music. So I made these motion graphics to translate this abstract feeling expressively. The original purpose of my project was to learn and practice skills of After Effect and Cinema 4D software. Through the progress of my project, I felt I am now much confident with the softwares. The first clip is from the song \'Strange Sensation\' by Xfruge and the second clip from \'The Open Boat\' by Primary&Colde.","writeASummaryOfTheProcessOfYourProject":"In the very beginning, the concept of my project is to research on the relationship between emotions and colors and visualize my research.

Suddenly I was out of idea what to do for my degree plan expect that I wanted to visualization abstract feelings. Whenever I got spare time after finished works, I like to listen to music. It helps me relax and put myself into an imaginary dreamy world. So I had this idea to visualize this world to share my feeling with other people. At first, I had no idea how to make the abstract imagination into objective things. At that time I got inspiration from some abstract motion graphics and painter Wassily Kandinsky’s paintings. I started by using just pure colors that I felt matching with the music and compose the very first mood board. At the same time, I looked for different tutorials and gave many tries. Then I designed my works as collections of effects that match with the music and compose them in the speed and order that fits the music.

Facing various social influences and temptations, most people gradually fall into the trap of oversimplification. People\'s minds are affected by vision, and the limitations of vision also counteract our thinking patterns. For instance, high-power cultures often appropriate culture fragments from low-power people, which results in incomplete information transmission. So recognizing the limitations of vision is relevant to us. A singular sight should not measure the hidden nature and illusions. I hope to state a learning view that guides people to realize the value of establishing a multi-dimensional thinking mode. My project explores how to use visual information to understand objects based on the timeline, trend, and context rather than just the matter itself.","writeASummaryOfTheProcessOfYourProject":"The game \\"Quick, Draw\\" developed by Google has collected over 50 million drawings,  the data can be used to study how people from all over the world draw.

This opinion leads me to a debate about the interaction between vision and thinking patterns. I realized that judging the nature and appearance of things should not be measured by a limited and standardized attitude. The education system like a production assembly-line makes people lack the capacity to appreciate the unique individuality. We often see incidents of cultural appropriation in the fashion industry, which makes me recognize that the transmission of information should not be exacerbated by fragmentation and distortion. Then I began to think about how to make people aware of the importance of multidimensional perspectives. Inspired by Kurt Vonnegut\'s book, slaughterhouse-five, I applied the perspective of four-dimensional creatures to our space. I proposed a learning view on how to use visual information to understand objects based on timeline, development trend, overall environment rather than just the object itself under single cognition.\\n","imagesMustBeUploadedUsingTheAboveInstructionsByMay10th12PmEdt":"I understand.","theResponsesToThisFormCanBeEditedEvenAfterSubmissionUpUntilMay10th12PmEdt":"I understand."},{"timestamp":"2020-05-08T01:59:41.874Z","emailAddress":"tba@mica.edu","whatIsYourPreferredFirstName":"Tianyi","whatIsYourPreferredLastName":"Ba","whatIsTheNameOfYourProject":"Some Things Above","ifYouHaveAWebsitePleaseAddItHere":"https://tianyi-ba.com/","ifYouHaveAnInstagramHandlePleaseAddItHere":"@tianyifeed_","writeASummaryOfYourProject":"After hundreds of millions of years, creatures on the earth have adapted to the alternation of day and night. But even so, the lights and high-rise buildings that represent modern civilization are still gradually confining the world to an increasingly narrow sky.

I hope to amplify the empathy point between humans and nature to motivate people\'s attention to light pollution, reflection on unconscious destruction, and awe of darkness/nature.","writeASummaryOfTheProcessOfYourProject":"The most significant obstacle to solving a problem is that people sometimes lack awareness and attention to this problem. Therefore, I started with the most common things in people\'s lives - lights, shadows, and plants. For three weeks in a row, I went out every night between 12 and 2 am to photograph the objects around the place: reflective street signs, tree shadows on the road, flashbulbs by the apartment, traffic lights reflected by glass windows, etc. While taking photos, I tried to overexpose the images as much as possible. After this, I added histogram images on each picture, implying the abnormal states of those objects and also an abstract symbolization of cities.\\nThe moment when people are most affected is when they resonate. Sometimes emotion-based expressions are more persuasive than straightforward narration. Based on the experience of being in the dark for the past three weeks, I designed another book of poetry - \\"City\'s Victory Over Night.\\" It collects a series of poems about the night from all over the world.

My goal is to engage in a process and create a body of work that authentically expresses my personal experiences. \\n\\nThrough creating and sharing very personally about myself I hope to encourage others \\nto feel safe and vulnerable enough to do the same.","writeASummaryOfTheProcessOfYourProject":"This project began with me searching for a way to process my emotions and experiences. I consider myself a private person and have difficulties opening up and being vulnerable. I choose to internalize most things, letting them run through-n-through my head till the tension is released unintentionally often in the worst ways. I could no longer do this to myself and others. Why couldn’t I be honest? What was I afraid of?\\n\\nAs a way to process and manage a deep depression I started writing. This was the easiest way to release all the things I felt, the things I needed to say. When I started writing at this point in my life it saved me. Sometimes it was the only way I could get out of bed. Even if nobody was to ever see what I had to say it was released from my mind and body. \\n\\nAs I started creating work I was interested in art therapy practices and what they fulfilled. I researched into some techniques and found that the way I was working fell into the “Person Centered” realm. Person centered expressive art therapy allows a person to express themselves without guidance from their therapist. They simply choose to create or not and reflection comes through sharing the piece at the end of the session. Throughout all the readings I did with art therapy and personal experiences sharing continued to be a main focus.\\n\\nSharing allows us to connect with others. It removes us from a constructed isolation that we may put ourselves in. As alone as we might feel at times, we never truly are. Sharing creates a trade of information and this trade allows us to explore more about ourselves and the world around us. When we open up and share and listen with others we can create healing spaces. Sharing can encourage others to feel more vulnerable once they see that someone else has taken that first step.\\n\\nParties and clubs are spaces that I felt allowed me to get the release I needed even if it was momentarily. The over stimulation from sound, movement, intoxication, and social engagement moved me to a place were I felt uninhibited and truly free. The clubs are very social and offer exchanges both verbally and physically. \\n\\nVisual inspiration came from party and club flyers. I have always felt a sense of authenticity from DIY flyers and low-fi party/nightclub scenes. Flyers are used as promotion for an event and framing my personal expressions as such promotes finding the space to allow yourself to be vulnerable. \\n\\nThe visual thread of club flyers allowed me to experiment and push the way I approach form making. I did not hold myself to any standard or specific visual method. Collage had become one process that really excited me. I enjoyed the deconstruction of something once known and the layering that could hide or reveal. Other processes I engaged in was RISO printing. The RISO felt like it fulfilled a lot of the aspects I was searching for; allowing me to collage directly for the printing process, the lo-fi appeal to DIY/club culture, and a way to quickly duplicate for distribution and sharing.\\n\\nThe final exhibition consisted of a newsprint poster series, a small publication as well as  a motion graphic. While the visual approach to all was not the same, they all started with writing. I did not do much planning for any design as I wanted them to feel honest to the moment they were created and the development that happened through experimenting.\\n\\nI hadn’t had a “personal” practice since before I started studying design. The personal never really had a place in design for me. I would use it to create platforms and encourage others to put themselves out there but I avoided the same encouragement for myself. The personal and emotional belong in design. Sharing ourselves as humans is important not just for ourselves, but for those around us. We all have stories and experiences, we all feel deeply, and we are all not alone in this world. \\n\\nReflecting on this project I have seen growth in myself both personally and in my design practice. It is hard to be vulnerable but it’s those honest connections that allows us to grow together. This project has influenced where I see my independent practice going. I want to continue to share myself for the sake of my own healing, and the sake of others. I want to promote others to do the same. The personal is universal and it is important that we find the space for honest vulnerable connections. We are all human and we can all support each other.","imagesMustBeUploadedUsingTheAboveInstructionsByMay10th12PmEdt":"I understand.","theResponsesToThisFormCanBeEditedEvenAfterSubmissionUpUntilMay10th12PmEdt":"I understand."},{"timestamp":"2020-05-08T02:57:47.025Z","emailAddress":"jmartinezrivas@mica.edu","whatIsYourPreferredFirstName":"Julia ","whatIsYourPreferredLastName":"Martinez-Rivas","whatIsTheNameOfYourProject":"Little Lesson(s) ","ifYouHaveAnInstagramHandlePleaseAddItHere":"jaymarty98","writeASummaryOfYourProject":"My thesis is to introduce the thinking of graphic design with short lessons and workshops.

For me, the project is not over, it will continue. It is not so much the final result, but what I gained in the design process.The first is to learn to think and design independently and enjoy the design process. The design process is contradictory, suspicious, surprising, happy... all the complex emotions rolled together. The experience of the design process is unique to the designer. This is that the process is often much richer than the experience brought to me by the result. In the end, what the public sees is the result. Even if the designer spreads out the process, it is difficult to convey the emotion and feeling that the designer gained during the process. So the design of pleasure or pain all belongs to the treasure of the designer.The second is to learn to give design time. Good design takes time to develop. Don\'t try to achieve your goals in one second or even one minute. From the inspiration to the final output, it takes time to study, think, and design. You may not find the right direction, clear goals, or even visualize your idea. But you have to push yourself, research, ask yourself questions, be patient. When it’s time, a lot of things will come naturally, and you may even get a surprise that you didn\'t expect before. In the documentary Life Is Fruity, grandmother Eiko said that Shuichi often told her to do what she could do slowly but firmly, and she did so and gained a lot. Finally, when I look back on the whole process of design, I am happy. I not only get a thesis design, but also feel my growth and change.","imagesMustBeUploadedUsingTheAboveInstructionsByMay10th12PmEdt":"I understand.","theResponsesToThisFormCanBeEditedEvenAfterSubmissionUpUntilMay10th12PmEdt":"I understand."},{"timestamp":"2020-05-08T04:35:17.552Z","emailAddress":"clanglais@mica.edu","whatIsYourPreferredFirstName":"Chris","whatIsYourPreferredLastName":"Langlais","whatIsTheNameOfYourProject":"Experiential Design","ifYouHaveAWebsitePleaseAddItHere":"http://www.clanglais.design","ifYouHaveAnInstagramHandlePleaseAddItHere":"clanglais.design","writeASummaryOfYourProject":"Using elements of design to convey the sensory experience of an object (smell, taste, texture, feel) through a visual medium.

The shapes, along with the gentle and pastel color palettes I chose were meant to reflect the newfound friendliness I applied to the creatures, while also indicating the fact that the existence of them is ultimately open-ended and nothing about them is defined.

Seeing my book in its final form makes me appreciate all the hard work that went into this and I am so happy to finally be able to share it with you.","imagesMustBeUploadedUsingTheAboveInstructionsByMay10th12PmEdt":"I understand.","theResponsesToThisFormCanBeEditedEvenAfterSubmissionUpUntilMay10th12PmEdt":"I understand."},{"timestamp":"2020-05-09T00:14:46.414Z","emailAddress":"swu02@mica.edu","whatIsYourPreferredFirstName":"Shuang","whatIsYourPreferredLastName":"Wu","whatIsTheNameOfYourProject":"Museum of Pets-Pellow","ifYouHaveAWebsitePleaseAddItHere":"https://shuanglunawu.com/","ifYouHaveAnInstagramHandlePleaseAddItHere":"reawakening47","writeASummaryOfYourProject":"Pellow is a animal-centered, designed-oriented app that helps pet owner to find \\"the one\\" furry friend.

It is an abstract store with full imagination that is selling scent and memory. Smell is one of our most sensitive senses and is most closely related to our memories and feelings. It plays such an important role in our brain. Different smells can bring you back to distant memories, change our emotions, and even help you connect with those you love. Therefore, when we experience a scent that is stored in our memory, our brain tends to associate it with certain memories, and the emotions involved with them. The way SniffSniff\'s operating is to shop, to create, to share the most unique and memorable scents in people’s minds. When shopping for a particular scent at the store, you can also get the personal memories/stories behind it. There are 6 Basic Emotional Reactions to Scent due to study. Based on that the store labeled the scents in six types of emotions with different representative colors and shapes.","writeASummaryOfTheProcessOfYourProject":"To start the project, I first did some research about relationships between scents, memories, and emotions, and got to know the basic information. And look through some of the sensory design related to scents. Before I jumped into designing the branding, I interviewed my friends and family about 4 questions related to the topic I was focused on. Their answer helps me to build up my ideas to start designing everything. I start with the logo design as my first step. With the continuous improvement, after getting the final version of the logo, I moved to work on the packaging illustration of the scents bottle. Since the store is an ideal one, I decided to create the scents bottle as a graphic illustration instead of a real bottle mockup. The website is my last step of the project, it starts at the home page then moves to other pages like shop, about and create. Changes happened when getting new feedback every week.

These terms have not only angered Chinese officials but have led to an increase in hate crimes and xenophobic attacks targeting the Asian American community. Incidents included being told to go back to China, blamed for being the origin of the virus, and being physically assaulted due to the spread of misinformation. Social media campaigns have launched, online incident reports have been created and hotlines have been implemented by local governments to combat racism and xenophobia. \\n\\nThis research-driven project includes extensive research on the origins of the coronavirus, referencing statistical studies of discrimination towards Asian-Americans, conducting interviews and compiling screenshots of social media posts about misinformation about the COVID-19 and personal responses of what it is like to be Chinese American amid this global pandemic.\\n\\nMy work explores how cultural Identity impacts one to question their origins, both from a cultural and political viewpoint.

To explore my ideas, I researched the history of Chinese in the Americas and the stereotypes surrounding Asian American culture. I created a series of two-week experimental projects exploring cultural appropriation, international adoption, and the model minority myth. The final body of work uncovers the narrative of a Chinese-American transracial adoptee, Baixue Yang, born under China’s one-child policy and the internal struggles she faced while exploring her ethnic identity. \\n\\nPart II - Asian American Racism amid COVID-19\\n\\nIn the second part of my thesis, I created a body of work in response to the increase of racist and xenophobic attacks since the start of the coronavirus global pandemic. I conducted extensive research, read countless articles, studied online hate crime attack forms, analyzed the trends of misinformation in tweets, and created visual responses in response to social media campaign #Hate Is A Virus. My commentary takes two uniquely American creations, caution tape, and fortune cookies, and recontextualizes them in the age of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a Chinese American, I felt strongly about working with these two mediums to create a piece that brings awareness on how Trump\'s initial name for the coronavirus, “Chinese Virus” have not only negatively impacted the Asian American population, but have contributed to the decline in America\'s Chinatowns.\\n","imagesMustBeUploadedUsingTheAboveInstructionsByMay10th12PmEdt":"I understand.","theResponsesToThisFormCanBeEditedEvenAfterSubmissionUpUntilMay10th12PmEdt":"I understand."},{"timestamp":"2020-05-09T02:49:48.316Z","emailAddress":"jscaraville@mica.edu","whatIsYourPreferredFirstName":"Jenn","whatIsYourPreferredLastName":"Scaraville","whatIsTheNameOfYourProject":"SELF CARE IS AN INSIDE JOB","ifYouHaveAWebsitePleaseAddItHere":"https://www.jennscaraville.com/","ifYouHaveAnInstagramHandlePleaseAddItHere":"jscaraville.design","writeASummaryOfYourProject":"PRACTICING SELF CARE IS GROWING INCREASINGLY PREVALENT.
