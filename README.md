## ðŸŽ“ Maryland Institute College of Art's Graphic Design BFA 2020 Exhibition
Historically, MICA's Artwalk Exhibition has been a physical space for viewers to come in and experience in-person degree projects by our graduating class. Due to COVID-19, this pandemic rejuvenated a team of graduating students in the BFA Graphic Design program to spearhead, lead, and invent this alternative virtual exhibition for their class.
