Music is a method to express emotions and thoughts. The audience may or may not get the emotions lying in the music. However, when I listen to music, I tend to imagine the melody as space. Inside that space, every note turns into particles that fill this imaginary space with expressive colors and shapes. In my project, I wanted to visualize music to recreate the small universe I imagined while listening to the music. I took one clip from each of the two songs and tried to transfer the feelings from my motion graphics. The graphics in my videos represent the mood I felt in my perspective. The relaxing and lazy atmosphere is transformed into a soft, dreamy, dizzy, and retro grainy style. This is my understanding reacted to these two clips of music. Of course, different people would have a different experience when listening to the same pieces of music. So I made these motion graphics to translate this abstract feeling expressively. The original purpose of my project was to learn and practice skills of After Effect and Cinema 4D software. Through the progress of my project, I felt I am now much confident with the softwares.

Facing various social influences and temptations, most people gradually fall into the trap of oversimplification. People\'s minds are affected by vision, and the limitations of vision also counteract our thinking patterns. For instance, high-power cultures often appropriate culture fragments from low-power people, which results in incomplete information transmission. So recognizing the limitations of vision is relevant to us. A singular sight should not measure the hidden nature and illusions. I hope to state a learning view that guides people to realize the value of establishing a multi-dimensional thinking mode.

This opinion leads me to a debate about the interaction between vision and thinking patterns. I realized that judging the nature and appearance of things should not be measured by a limited and standardized attitude. The education system like a production assembly-line makes people lack the capacity to appreciate the unique individuality. We often see incidents of cultural appropriation in the fashion industry, which makes me recognize that the transmission of information should not be exacerbated by fragmentation and distortion. Then I began to think about how to make people aware of the importance of multidimensional perspectives. Inspired by Kurt Vonnegut\'s book, slaughterhouse-five, I applied the perspective of four-dimensional creatures to our space.

My goal is to engage in a process and create a body of work that authentically expresses my personal experiences. \\n\\nThrough creating and sharing very personally about myself I hope to encourage others \\nto feel safe and vulnerable enough to do the same.","writeASummaryOfTheProcessOfYourProject":"This project began with me searching for a way to process my emotions and experiences. I consider myself a private person and have difficulties opening up and being vulnerable. I choose to internalize most things, letting them run through-n-through my head till the tension is released unintentionally often in the worst ways. I could no longer do this to myself and others. Why couldn’t I be honest? What was I afraid of?\\n\\nAs a way to process and manage a deep depression I started writing. This was the easiest way to release all the things I felt, the things I needed to say. When I started writing at this point in my life it saved me. Sometimes it was the only way I could get out of bed. Even if nobody was to ever see what I had to say it was released from my mind and body. \\n\\nAs I started creating work I was interested in art therapy practices and what they fulfilled. I researched into some techniques and found that the way I was working fell into the “Person Centered” realm. Person centered expressive art therapy allows a person to express themselves without guidance from their therapist. They simply choose to create or not and reflection comes through sharing the piece at the end of the session. Throughout all the readings I did with art therapy and personal experiences sharing continued to be a main focus.\\n\\nSharing allows us to connect with others. It removes us from a constructed isolation that we may put ourselves in. As alone as we might feel at times, we never truly are. Sharing creates a trade of information and this trade allows us to explore more about ourselves and the world around us. When we open up and share and listen with others we can create healing spaces. Sharing can encourage others to feel more vulnerable once they see that someone else has taken that first step.\\n\\nParties and clubs are spaces that I felt allowed me to get the release I needed even if it was momentarily. The over stimulation from sound, movement, intoxication, and social engagement moved me to a place were I felt uninhibited and truly free. The clubs are very social and offer exchanges both verbally and physically. \\n\\nVisual inspiration came from party and club flyers. I have always felt a sense of authenticity from DIY flyers and low-fi party/nightclub scenes. Flyers are used as promotion for an event and framing my personal expressions as such promotes finding the space to allow yourself to be vulnerable. \\n\\nThe visual thread of club flyers allowed me to experiment and push the way I approach form making. I did not hold myself to any standard or specific visual method. Collage had become one process that really excited me. I enjoyed the deconstruction of something once known and the layering that could hide or reveal. Other processes I engaged in was RISO printing. The RISO felt like it fulfilled a lot of the aspects I was searching for; allowing me to collage directly for the printing process, the lo-fi appeal to DIY/club culture, and a way to quickly duplicate for distribution and sharing.\\n\\nThe final exhibition consisted of a newsprint poster series, a small publication as well as  a motion graphic. While the visual approach to all was not the same, they all started with writing. I did not do much planning for any design as I wanted them to feel honest to the moment they were created and the development that happened through experimenting.\\n\\nI hadn’t had a “personal” practice since before I started studying design. The personal never really had a place in design for me. I would use it to create platforms and encourage others to put themselves out there but I avoided the same encouragement for myself. The personal and emotional belong in design. Sharing ourselves as humans is important not just for ourselves, but for those around us. We all have stories and experiences, we all feel deeply, and we are all not alone in this world. \\n\\nReflecting on this project I have seen growth in myself both personally and in my design practice. It is hard to be vulnerable but it’s those honest connections that allows us to grow together. This project has influenced where I see my independent practice going. I want to continue to share myself for the sake of my own healing, and the sake of others. I want to promote others to do the same. The personal is universal and it is important that we find the space for honest vulnerable connections. We are all human and we can all support each other.","imagesMustBeUploadedUsingTheAboveInstructionsByMay10th12PmEdt":"I understand.","theResponsesToThisFormCanBeEditedEvenAfterSubmissionUpUntilMay10th12PmEdt":"I understand."},{"timestamp":"2020-05-08T02:57:47.025Z","emailAddress":"jmartinezrivas@mica.edu","whatIsYourPreferredFirstName":"Julia ","whatIsYourPreferredLastName":"Martinez-Rivas","whatIsTheNameOfYourProject":"Little Lesson(s) ","ifYouHaveAnInstagramHandlePleaseAddItHere":"jaymarty98","writeASummaryOfYourProject":"My thesis is to introduce the thinking of graphic design with short lessons and workshops.

For me, the project is not over, it will continue. It is not so much the final result, but what I gained in the design process.The first is to learn to think and design independently and enjoy the design process. The design process is contradictory, suspicious, surprising, happy... all the complex emotions rolled together. The experience of the design process is unique to the designer. This is that the process is often much richer than the experience brought to me by the result. In the end, what the public sees is the result. Even if the designer spreads out the process, it is difficult to convey the emotion and feeling that the designer gained during the process. So the design of pleasure or pain all belongs to the treasure of the designer.The second is to learn to give design time. Good design takes time to develop. Don\'t try to achieve your goals in one second or even one minute. From the inspiration to the final output, it takes time to study, think, and design. You may not find the right direction, clear goals, or even visualize your idea. But you have to push yourself, research, ask yourself questions, be patient. When it’s time, a lot of things will come naturally, and you may even get a surprise that you didn\'t expect before. In the documentary Life Is Fruity, grandmother Eiko said that Shuichi often told her to do what she could do slowly but firmly, and she did so and gained a lot. Finally, when I look back on the whole process of design, I am happy.

I redefined their identities and gave them each their own unique friendly personalities, along with relatable characteristics that humanize these beings that aren\'t human at all.

I initially started drafting some of the characters in a more detailed and sketchy looking comic style, but because of possible time restrictions and considering the body text that I would have to write too, I revised the characters into these simple nebulous/amorphous shapes that have more design flexibility and are a more contemporary approach to cryptid/creature art. The shapes, along with the gentle and pastel color palettes I chose were meant to reflect the newfound friendliness I applied to the creatures, while also indicating the fact that the existence of them is ultimately open-ended and nothing about them is defined.

It plays such an important role in our brain. Different smells can bring you back to distant memories, change our emotions, and even help you connect with those you love. Therefore, when we experience a scent that is stored in our memory, our brain tends to associate it with certain memories, and the emotions involved with them. The way SniffSniff\'s operating is to shop, to create, to share the most unique and memorable scents in people’s minds. When shopping for a particular scent at the store, you can also get the personal memories/stories behind it. There are 6 Basic Emotional Reactions to Scent due to study.

Their answer helps me to build up my ideas to start designing everything. I start with the logo design as my first step. With the continuous improvement, after getting the final version of the logo, I moved to work on the packaging illustration of the scents bottle. Since the store is an ideal one, I decided to create the scents bottle as a graphic illustration instead of a real bottle mockup.
