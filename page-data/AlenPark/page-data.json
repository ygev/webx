I will design a series of examples to demonstrate how my background font could be used. I will create diverse posters showcasing different alphabets. This project is an experiment with diverse functions of typography. My idea is to create a decorative font that can support the main source of the design. My font can be used for visual interest, not for legibility or stylish display. I hope this new category of fonts keeps going after my project is presenting, demonstrating a new use for typography. To download and try the font as an illustrator file : https://www.dropbox.com/s/pww3dahe3c1po37/escher_font.ai?dl=0","projectProcess":"My inspiration was from Maurits Cornelis Escher's art and I wanted to express the 3D and 2D at the same time. I added the colors in the system so that people can express diverse creativity within the background type font. I've developed cool-line and warm-line version of the fonts. These posters are the example of using a letter A for the background of posters. However, I want to let people know that this font isn't only for the poster, it can be used for other purposes such as album cover, book cover, or any platforms. These great designers from MICA were thankfully supported the project with using my fonts and created posters. This font is free and the download link is down below.
