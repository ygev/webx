There are 4 main components to this project. First, I discussed the static and additive nature of the canvas, and how reductive design can help us make better design decisions. I then talked about using generative randomness to inspire new UI patterns. Thirdly, I examined the diverging and converging nature of design, and how code-based web design tools can help us create more realistic websites. Lastly, I challenged the hegemony of proprietary design software and proposed using or developing experimental tools to democratize design.","projectProcess":"The main outcome of my project is writing, software development, and print design. I started out by researching and gathering alternative design tools and perspectives on are.na. I also developed a Figma plugin that generates interface design systems. I collected snippets of my ideas in writing, which were later edited and revised into my final essays. I created a book that accompanies my essays and composed visual themes that echo my writing. "}}}
