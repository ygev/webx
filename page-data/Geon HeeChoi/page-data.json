He suffered from acute myeloid leukemia for 6 months. When he was diagnosed, it was too late. The affected white blood cells already spreaded out all over the blood. I was studying in Ireland at that time away from my family due to study. I did not know that he passed away until his funeral was over because my parents were worried about me. Me and my uncle had a lot of good memories and he especially took care of me because I was his first nephew. After he passed away, I had lots of thoughts about the blood and leukemia. For this time, aesthetic points of view and the other artistic thoughts were excluded. Purely this project is about my thoughts on blood and leukemia.\nThis project dedicates to my beloved uncle who loved me from the bottom of his heart. You would be proud how me and my younger brother are doing. I am almost your age when you were diagnosed.","projectProcess":"Without blood, I do not exist. Someone needs blood and the others can help with the someone who needs. I did not have a lot of ideas on blood because it is here always. After my uncle passed away, I created new perspective on blood. Blood is valuable for everyone no matter what. It can save someone. Blood consists of various cells. Each cell functions differently. From the heart and the vein through my body to each cells. I want to shape my ideas with artistic sense that I have. I do not want to create something leans on aesthetic. I want to create the works that come from my heart. Any other works that I can make, I can focus on beauty of it but I want to purely focus on what I think this time."}}}
