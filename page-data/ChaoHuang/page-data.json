Everyone has two living spaces: physical and mental. Personal boundaries mainly divided to physical and psychological boundaries. In contrast to the physical boundaries, psychological boundaries are invisible and untouchable. So we used to ignore psychological boundaries. However, psychological boundaries affect our interactions with others and can cause many relationship problems.\nThe project aims to help people visualize their psychological boundaries and establish healthy psychological boundaries.","projectProcess":"Although some aspects are not up to my expectations, I am quite satisfied. For me, the project is not over, it will continue. It is not so much the final result, but what I gained in the design process.The first is to learn to think and design independently and enjoy the design process. The design process is contradictory, suspicious, surprising, happy... all the complex emotions rolled together. The experience of the design process is unique to the designer. This is that the process is often much richer than the experience brought to me by the result. In the end, what the public sees is the result. Even if the designer spreads out the process, it is difficult to convey the emotion and feeling that the designer gained during the process. So the design of pleasure or pain all belongs to the treasure of the designer.The second is to learn to give design time. Good design takes time to develop. Don't try to achieve your goals in one second or even one minute. From the inspiration to the final output, it takes time to study, think, and design. You may not find the right direction, clear goals, or even visualize your idea. But you have to push yourself, research, ask yourself questions, be patient. When itâ€™s time, a lot of things will come naturally, and you may even get a surprise that you didn't expect before. In the documentary Life Is Fruity, grandmother Eiko said that Shuichi often told her to do what she could do slowly but firmly, and she did so and gained a lot. Finally, when I look back on the whole process of design, I am happy. I not only get a thesis design, but also feel my growth and change."}}}
