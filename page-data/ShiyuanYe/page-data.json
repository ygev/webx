It is an abstract store with full imagination that is selling scent and memory. Smell is one of our most sensitive senses and is most closely related to our memories and feelings. It plays such an important role in our brain. Different smells can bring you back to distant memories, change our emotions, and even help you connect with those you love. Therefore, when we experience a scent that is stored in our memory, our brain tends to associate it with certain memories, and the emotions involved with them. The way SniffSniff's operating is to shop, to create, to share the most unique and memorable scents in people’s minds. When shopping for a particular scent at the store, you can also get the personal memories/stories behind it. There are 6 Basic Emotional Reactions to Scent due to study. Based on that the store labeled the scents in six types of emotions with different representative colors and shapes.

And look through some of the sensory design related to scents. Before I jumped into designing the branding, I interviewed my friends and family about 4 questions related to the topic I was focused on. Their answer helps me to build up my ideas to start designing everything. I start with the logo design as my first step. With the continuous improvement, after getting the final version of the logo, I moved to work on the packaging illustration of the scents bottle. Since the store is an ideal one, I decided to create the scents bottle as a graphic illustration instead of a real bottle mockup. The website is my last step of the project, it starts at the home page then moves to other pages like shop, about and create. Changes happened when getting new feedback every week. "}}}
