People put up with their emotions in consideration of various situations. Many people get the disease, “Hwa-byung”, which is one of a mental illness that originated in South Korea. This is because lots of people can’t express their feelings. I went back to the first ideation again that is about the mental health of people decided to concentrate. So, I decided to make an emotional guide book for people. This guidebook is also not a medical method. Also, this guidebook contains a natural way of laughing, crying. This guide book will help in humorous ways for people’s emotional management.","projectProcess":"I search the people's mental illness and found that the term \"Hwa-byung\" is only familiar with Korean. I am interested in this term so I studied it. After gathering the information, I made a guidebook and additional posters based on this information."}}}
