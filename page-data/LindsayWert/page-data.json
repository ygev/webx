The visual concept is a person stepping through the pages of a book and experiencing another world. Water World is the name of the book and once a viewer steps inside they will experience how I imagine what this world would be like. There are two main parts of this interactive installation. First is the book door, which the viewer will open and walk through into a canopy tent. Next the viewer will be engulfed in a space with lights and various green and blue fabrics surrounding them. While in this water world they will hear my voice reading book quotes and poems that feature watery scenes over top of ocean and rain sounds. This project will hopefully be impactful on its audience by giving them an experience that informs or reminds them how reading benefits us by giving us a chance to escape reality for a little while. From this project and exhibition viewers should take away a memorable experience. ","projectProcess":"First part of my processes was deciding on which way my thesis questions concept would best convey the message. I wanted to really have my audience physically step through a book and be sucked into another world. The best way to do this was to build an interactive installation that activated the senses. I had limited space so I decided to use a small canopy tent as the room and build a door for it that looks like a book. Next I had to think of what book and world my audience would be walking into. This was tough. There are just so many great books. So I came up with a theme instead and that was water. Water World would be a collection of poems and quoted book scenes having to do with water.\n\nI then broke up my weeks focusing on one section at a time. The inside of the tent was planned first, next the book door, then the outside of the tent. Each part was approached in a similar way. Researching and getting inspiration then sketching out ideas and making many lists. After gathering all the materials the building and setting up began. The whole thing was in my garage and the plan was to work on it there, take pictures and notes of the final product and then rebuild it in the space given to me.        "}}}
