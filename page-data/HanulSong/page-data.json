As much as we see how diverse communities have become we also see the rise of racism and competition between countries. Through this project I wanted to focus on looking into ‘our similarities’ rather than 'our differences' as humanity, and so the project takes on to raise awareness on the 17 global goals for sustainable development and promote global citizenship. ","projectProcess":"The project began with the question, how might we design to promote diversity and inclusion? Before the ideation process, I started by researching what it means to design to empower and share people's experiences, and raise awareness on how diverse the world is. I knew that at the end of the day I wanted people to understand that the future of the world depends on everyone and that we are in this together and belong to one community, thus the design choices were made upon to speak to a more diverse audience. \n"}}}
