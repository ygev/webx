Applied Memetics is a project which takes a curatorial approach to memes, examining them as pieces of art and design through various lenses of inquiry.","projectProcess":"This project had several distinct areas of process: research/inspiration-gathering/competitive analysis, brand building, information architecture, writing, user testing, and coding. Part of the reason why I enjoyed developing this work is that it allowed me to explore several of my interests within design in one unified body. \n\nAs a project (and a virtual project at that) which I plan to launch, maintain, and grow post-graduation, the \"process\" never ends. There's always something new to add, always something old to revise."}}}
