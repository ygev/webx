THE MODERN INTERPRETATION OF SELF CARE IMPLIES TIME AND MONEY FOR LEISURE, WHICH IS NOT EQUALLY ACCESSIBLE. IN MY DEGREE PROJECT, I AIM TO CRITIQUE THE PRIVILEGE ASSOCIATED WITH SELF CARE CULTURE. I EXPLORE THE BARRIERS THAT VARIOUS PEOPLES FACE WHILE ATTEMPTING TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES WITHIN A CAPITALIST SOCIETY. SELF CARE HAS STRAYED FROM ITS ROOTS IN FEMINISM, ACTIVISM, AND PRESERVING IDENTITY, TO A MASS MARKET, EXHAUSTED NEOLOGISM FOR PRIVILEGED LEISURE. BY CONTRASTING COMMODIFIED OBJECTS OF SELF CARE WITH STATEMENTS OF POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND SOCIAL ISSUES, I INTEND TO BRING ATTENTION TO THE FLAWS IN CAPITALIST CULTURE. I ALSO AIM TO DRAW ATTENTION TO CAPITALISMâ€™S INFILTRATION INTO PRINTED EPHEMERA THROUGH ADVERTISEMENTS FOR COMMERCIAL GOODS, ESPECIALLY WITHIN A CONTEXT PROMOTING SELF CARE.
