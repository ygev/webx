The modern interpretation of self care implies time and money for leisure, which is not equally accessible. In my degree project, I aim to critique the privileges associated with self care culture. I explore the barriers that various peoples face while attempting to take care of themselves within a capitalist society. Self care has strayed from its roots in feminism, activism, and preserving identity to a mass market, exhausted neologism for privileged leisure.. By contrasting commodified objects of self care with statements of political, economic, and social issues, I intend to bring attention to the flaws in capitalist culture. I also aim to draw attention to capitalism’s infiltration into printed ephemera through advertisements for commercial goods, especially within a context promoting self care.","projectProcess":"My process for this project was very research based. I spent months attempting to put what I wanted to critique into words and then into actualization. I read an abundance of articles on “self care” across varying viewpoints. I gathered articles, read research studies, did mind-mapping, sketches, and created lists. My project evolved through learning and gathering differing viewpoints. Initially, I was focused on critiquing the commodification of self care and how it has become just another thing to do and post on social media. By working on this project over a few months, my thesis matured and I focused more on accessibility of care, inequality, and intersectionality. My initial project plan was to create digital posters overlayed with health statistics in a custom lettered font. That concept was short lived, and I quickly switched to a printmaking based approach. I designed a series of riso prints, contrasting statements of inequality with commodified objects of self care. The printing was simple; I took care to write statements that point out the obvious, in a slightly satirical way. Through this project I learned screenprinting and I utilized the technique to create hand lettered, illustrative prints with broad statements about self care culture, such as “spending money is not self care.” These prints are not included in my final series because I wanted to focus on issues of intersectionality and accessibility. I intend to continue learning about these topics, and allow them to guide and inform my future projects."}}}
