They create customizing candles and aroma oils based on a customer’s story. If customers send their stories to them, they create the scent of the memory. It is based on the memory of people, location, and what happens. The scent will be different from each customer. ","projectProcess":"Initial ideation is started with scents. The scent is a strong medium that can bring a memory. I believe that keeping a scent means keeping memory. With this in mind, my objective is keeping memory with candles and aroma oil. In the first ideation, I would like to show the Korean \"memory,\" which is a pretty beautiful shape, but I designed \"GIUK\" that is Korean word of \"memory.\"Brand research is based on a simple concept. “GIUK” is a customizing brand, so package labels should be flexible for customizing with various customers' stories. The final outputs show a solid line to organize various information. The initial branding of “GIUK” is designed based on black and white. Before putting the bright colors, I tried to design a simpler outcome. This step is pretty helpful for designing the current outcome because it could be foundation of the “GIUK” brand. \n"}}}
