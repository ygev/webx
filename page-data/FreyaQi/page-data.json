Facing various social influences and temptations, most people gradually fall into the trap of oversimplification. People's minds are affected by vision, and the limitations of vision also counteract our thinking patterns. For instance, high-power cultures often appropriate culture fragments from low-power people, which results in incomplete information transmission. So recognizing the limitations of vision is relevant to us. A singular sight should not measure the hidden nature and illusions. I hope to state a learning view that guides people to realize the value of establishing a multi-dimensional thinking mode. My project explores how to use visual information to understand objects based on the timeline, trend, and context rather than just the matter itself.","projectProcess":"The game \"Quick, Draw\" developed by Google has collected over 50 million drawings,  the data can be used to study how people from all over the world draw. By comparing the ways and characteristics of these drawings of basic graphics, I understand that culture has an impact on the way people draw, and education can affect people's vision. This opinion leads me to a debate about the interaction between vision and thinking patterns. I realized that judging the nature and appearance of things should not be measured by a limited and standardized attitude. The education system like a production assembly-line makes people lack the capacity to appreciate the unique individuality. We often see incidents of cultural appropriation in the fashion industry, which makes me recognize that the transmission of information should not be exacerbated by fragmentation and distortion. Then I began to think about how to make people aware of the importance of multidimensional perspectives. Inspired by Kurt Vonnegut's book, slaughterhouse-five, I applied the perspective of four-dimensional creatures to our space. I proposed a learning view on how to use visual information to understand objects based on timeline, development trend, overall environment rather than just the object itself under single cognition.\n"}}}
