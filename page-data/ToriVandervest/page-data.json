Small businesses and family owned shops are so important to our communities and they are becoming harder and harder to find. My goal is to share the stories of these stores, both past and present, and to illustrate why they are so important and to show the lasting memories that these places have on people.","projectProcess":"My original plan was to create an immersive exhibition featuring booklets and prints and many photos, which were provided by the individuals who agreed to talk to me about their family store or a store they remember. Because of the restrictions of quarantine, I decided to create a website instead that had a tangibility to the layout, featuring collages of images and writings and Baltimore ephemera. "}}}
