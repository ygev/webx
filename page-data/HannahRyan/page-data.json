In a time where things don't seem to be moving forward, these globes remind us of the objects we've held onto forever and how we can use their memories to take us back in time. Each globe is a vignette of the most nostalgic objects interviewees shared with me, centered in the middle of little worlds that elaborate on their objects’ stories. Their stories can be found alongside their globes at vessel.cargo.site","projectProcess":"This project is a result of nine months of research, iteration, process, and creation. I began working in August 2019 with the idea of home, and spent my time up until late January on that subject. I discovered in early February that the aspect of home I was most interested in was the nostalgia, at which point my research and creative process shifted to its current trajectory. My final pieces are vignettes of others’ *memories of their most nostalgic *objects. In representing nostalgia through objects, I found it easier to ground my project in something physical in order to bring my more conceptual research into the physical realm for my design work. I titled my project “vessel” because I felt that these objects all represent more than meets the eye, and they’re carriers of valuable stories and emotion.\n"}}}
