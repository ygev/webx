","projectProcess":"I began in August working through the concept of home and how it could be analyzed through disaster. Come January, my research felt exhausted and I still didn't have a project that made me excited. At this point, I came to the realization that the topic I had been writing most about was actually nostalgia. I took this time to shift my thesis towards the intersection of nostalgia and material culture, and settled on this final direction for my project. All of my images were created in Cinema 4D. "}}}
