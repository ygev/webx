But even so, the lights and high-rise buildings that represent modern civilization are still gradually confining the world to an increasingly narrow sky. People live in the city and relish the material enjoyment at the expense of pollution. What does light pollution cost us? I hope to amplify the empathy point between humans and nature to motivate people's attention to light pollution, reflection on unconscious destruction, and awe of darkness/nature.","projectProcess":"The most significant obstacle to solving a problem is that people sometimes lack awareness and attention to this problem. Therefore, I started with the most common things in people's lives - lights, shadows, and plants. For three weeks in a row, I went out every night between 12 and 2 am to photograph the objects around the place: reflective street signs, tree shadows on the road, flashbulbs by the apartment, traffic lights reflected by glass windows, etc. While taking photos, I tried to overexpose the images as much as possible. After this, I added histogram images on each picture, implying the abnormal states of those objects and also an abstract symbolization of cities.\nThe moment when people are most affected is when they resonate. Sometimes emotion-based expressions are more persuasive than straightforward narration. Based on the experience of being in the dark for the past three weeks, I designed another book of poetry - \"City's Victory Over Night.\" It collects a series of poems about the night from all over the world. In order to enable readers to better involve and feel, poetry collections are not limited by the size and style of the paper. I hope that the deliverables can convey the connection between night and people so that people and people's awe of darkness and nature."}}}
