Through the exploration of major cash crops: sugar cane, cotton, and wood, this project use imagery to map the evolution of this relationship from antebellum into the current day. \n\n“Dawn and doom was in the branches.” - Zora Neale Hurston \n","projectProcess":"The process for this project began with research about cash crops that have made a significant impact on the lives of Black people in the Americas and West Indies. This was followed by the ideation of how to successfully communicate how the relationship between these crops and blackness did not end after the abolition of slavery but adapted into new and oppressive ways. Originally this project was supposed to be printed on my paper made out of sugar cane fibers known as bagasse, cotton, and wood fibers. The use of handmade paper was meant to incorporate the idea of labor to produce and harvest these crops. Due to this project being changed into having completely digital outputs, this component was scrapped.\n\nI chose to use appropriated imagery and text from historic black novelists and activists to serve as the script narrating the project. The final outputs include a triptych of posters, each focusing on sugar cane, cotton, and wood, each subsection of my research. Along with this, I created a zine to tell the story of this narrative in a way that can be accessible to all. \n"}}}
