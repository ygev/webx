I redefined their identities and gave them each their own unique friendly personalities, along with relatable characteristics that humanize these beings that aren't human at all. I took 6 of the more famous cryptids (Mothman, Bigfoot, The Loch Ness Monster, Aliens, The Kraken, and Nightcrawlers) and made them into a sociable friend group that partake in things that many of us do today, like social media, astrology, hobbies, etc. The result is a booklet that is theoretically made and written by these creatures, meant to be read by humans in hopes of resolving mankind's lasting desire for understanding/discovering these beings. ","projectProcess":"The early stages consisted of a lot of questioning of who exactly I wanted these cryptids to be in reference to humans. Humanizing something or making something \"relatable\" could mean a ton of things, so I specifically chose to align their personalities closest to a \"millennial\" or teen/college-aged person is like. \nAs far as the visuals and illustrations themselves, I chose between a few various styles, while keeping in mind what I thought my own illustration skills/limits were. I initially started drafting some of the characters in a more detailed and sketchy looking comic style, but because of possible time restrictions and considering the body text that I would have to write too, I revised the characters into these simple nebulous/amorphous shapes that have more design flexibility and are a more contemporary approach to cryptid/creature art. The shapes, along with the gentle and pastel color palettes I chose were meant to reflect the newfound friendliness I applied to the creatures, while also indicating the fact that the existence of them is ultimately open-ended and nothing about them is defined.
