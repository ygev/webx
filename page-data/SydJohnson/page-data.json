After researching famous cute mascots and brands, I began experimenting with character design and patternmaking. After working on countless designs and character ideas, I fell in love with the signature greyscale color palette, and ran with it.  I created a library of digital designs for use on homegoods, apparel, and stationery. In the end, I launched an online store for purchasing all the designs I've created during the project. "}}}
