This project gives a voice and equitable intervention to an area affected by disparities of crime and safety, the 100 block of N Montford Ave in Baltimore, MD, thirty-nine rowhomes located in Patterson Place, Southeast Baltimore. This project came from a space of me personally feeling lonely and disconnected from the world of physical human interaction. My deep desire to know my neighbors and build a relationship outside of saying hello, asking a neighbor to grab your package, or seeking video footage for a crime that took place on our block. My own experiences with crime, a home invasion, package thefts, car break-ins, and instances of feeling watched or in danger in the middle of the night have made me afraid of where I live. As the 100 block of N Montford Ave gentrifies, there is a unique opportunity to unite residents who have grown up and have been living on this block their entire life alongside new young homeowners looking to settle down, grow roots, or start families in Baltimore. My goals are to create a community, building upon the five households I already knew, establish a network of good neighbors and expand beyond simply knowing neighbors to the left and right of you, and on your side of the block. Lastly, my mission is to reduce crime and increase safety for all of the neighbors on our block by amplifying lighting on our street, mobilizing neighbors to be outside more often, and addressing unity for all neighbors through gentrification. I was pretty apprehensive about moving forward in quarantine during COVID-19, but I was surprised to learn that neighbors were more open to participating in block events during this time. I threw out an idea for a “Social Distancing Stoop Night” event on 3/20/2020, a few neighbors jumped on-board, and on the day of, our musician neighbors, THOSEPEOPLE, offered to perform for the block as practice before their live-stream. It was marvelous! We engaged neighbors in music and human interaction, with each person experiencing the concert, from their stoops or six feet of distance apart from one another, on the sidewalk. This event brought a sense of closeness, growth, and a moment of hope and brightness in our community during these challenging times. Throughout this project, the entire neighborhood was able to unite on the desire to get string lights up on our block. We had all seen these lights in Butcher’s Hill and on individual blocks in Patterson Park. That became a primary focus for my thesis, “Bmore Lights,” the installation of string lights on this block, addressing issues of gentrification, crime reduction, and community engagement in a productive way. These lights have brought an increased sense of safety, improve visibility on the sidewalk, encourage neighbors to be outside more, improves camera footage, and beautifies the neighborhood. On 5/7/2020, the first set of string lights went up on the even-numbered houses on the block. I hope to get these lights installed on the odd-numbered side by 5/28/2020, with eight homes left to garner support. I have received 78.3% buy-in so far for the cost of installing “Bmore Lights” on every single house on the block. Since the inception of this project, I now know thirty-two out of the thirty-nine rowhomes on the block. Whereas, I began my thesis only knowing five households. I have created the following for my block, a Facebook group with thirty members, a Facebook messenger chat group with forty neighbors, and the Contacts information of forty-six neighbors. As artists and designers, we have the power to affect change, together, we will transform our cities, nations, and the world, block by block, and envision a better world for all.

Speaking with each of them helped me understand why they moved here, what concerns they had around safety and crime, and hopes and changes they wished to see in our community. From there, they connected me with the neighbors they knew, and it grew on. The first one-on-one meeting I had was a “Make Your Own Pizza” night with one of our neighbors. They even got gluten-free flour just for me because of my food sensitivity. After speaking with this core group of neighbors, I observed that they each had guests take off their shoes when entering a home. Growing up in an Asian-American household, I have grown accustomed to not wearing shoes at home, but I was pleasantly surprised to see my diverse group of neighbors also sharing the same traditions in their own spaces. Initially, I had thought about hosting a “Neighborday” event, a holiday invented by GOOD Magazine in 2014, but I was apprehensive because I knew it would be a one-off. I was more interested in creating events that would be sustainable long-term. In one of my interviews, a neighbor said she always wanted to host a potluck in her home but didn’t have time for the details and logistics. I was more than happy to jump in and take over those responsibilities, so we united to make this event happen. At first, she was apprehensive about not knowing who would be coming and having another neighbor be uncomfortable with a particular person showing up. I took this challenge and was able to find a compromise. The other neighbor, who didn’t even live on our block, was taken off the list. I supplied the host with the exact number count, names, and where each attendee lived who would be attending our “Bmore Lights Potluck Meeting.” On 3/7/2020, this meet and greet were held at a neighbor’s home. It was a huge success. I felt awkward at first since I, too, didn’t know my neighbors. Still, it was great meeting so many new faces and having everyone connect with conversation and laughter around food and drinks. We had sixteen adults, five children, and two community leaders from Patterson Park Neighborhood Association attend from ten different households on the block. The goal of this meeting was to get a core group of neighbors to connect for the first time, foster relationships, and discuss installation and logistics for “Bmore Lights.” The meeting was well-received, concerns were addressed, and the next steps were given. We had 9 out of 10 households opt-in that night, agreeing to have string lights in front of their homes, being the power source, and giving permission to have a screw drilled into their brick, out of the 39 homes on the block. The one household who did not opt-in right away needed to discuss the details further with her wife. The next day, a handful of neighbors gathered together to watch the Lakers basketball game. The following week, a group of neighbors went knocking door-to-door to let neighbors know about the project and disseminate information and garner support. One neighbor commented, “Before the ‘Meet Your Neighbor’ initiative, we were apprehensive about staying in the neighborhood. Now that we have met some of our neighbors, joined in on the potluck, and were able to help get string lights on our block, we feel more connected to the community and are looking forward to spending more time in the area.” Special Thank You: Neighbors at 100 N Montford Ave and neighboring blocks, Jon Ferng, support, partner, and photographer for photos of Anne Xin, parents and family, support, Isaac Gertman, mentor, Kristian Bjornard, advisor, Brockett Horne, supporter, Dave Werkmeister, President of PPNA, Arch McKown, PPNA Safety Chair, Ernest Le, PPNA VP Patterson Place, Garrett Patrick, PPNA VP North Sector, Chris Beall, PPNA Crime and Data, partners and consultants, Chris Krogh, installer of “Bmore Lights,” Andy Dahl, Southeast CDC Manager of Neighborhood Programs, consultant, Beth Braun, President of Butcher’s Hill Association, consultant, Evgeniia Volkova, photographer for Bmore Lights Potluck Meeting, Siân Evans, MICA Graphic Design Librarian, resource, Ken Dippong, supporter, David Zeit, supporter, George Tyree, supporter, Enoch Pratt Free Central Library, research, Maryland Historical Society, research, Anne Xin, photographer and designer, MICA staff, faculty, students, friends who have supported me in this journey."}}}
