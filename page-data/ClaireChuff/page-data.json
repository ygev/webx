For my Graphic Design thesis project, I branded Metamuto, the company that will manufacture and sell my product design thesis. Metamuto creates modular, transformative furniture for new parents. The goal of metamuto is to create environmentally conscious furniture by extending product lifetime.  While metamuto is focused on reducing furniture waste, it is also focused on facilitating meaningful interactions between parent and child.","projectProcess":"The first step at the outset of this thesis project was to research how to design desire. I read several books on the topic which informed my process. The next step in my process was to examine existing brand guidelines to assess what elements would be necessary for my own guidelines. From there, I explored typefaces, grid structures, and logo design in order to arrive at my final concept."}}}
