It will be a continuing personal project that starts with one lesson. Over time more lessons will be added. These lessons are built to be easily accessible and adaptable. No Adobe software is needed for any of these lessons and be completed in classrooms or homes. ","projectProcess":"The process involved trial and error. Such as finding which method of transfer works best for ink type. Then which kind of printed material transfers the best. Finally when I got the hang of it. My next step was making the lesson as adaptable as I could so it is accessible to as many people as possible. "}}}
