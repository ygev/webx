As suggested by a peer, I became the face of the artist and had a peer take photographs of me. I designed a series of products to promote an artist and created an identity that made the whole branding cohesive. The final products are all digitalized and mocked-up. They consist of concert tickets, poster, vinyl covers, sweatshirt, iPhone cases, a VIP box, and an Instagram account. My desired outcome was to learn and create a whole branding system that relates to my interests and design passion. With all the inspirations and processes, I have successfully branded Stella Brown, the pop artist.","projectProcess":"My inspirations came from projects I made when I interned, and now work for, Sony Music Entertainment in Toronto. Visiting famous venues, such as the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville, Stedelijk Museum and MOCO Museum in Amsterdam, helped inspire me and guide me through my process. I started to gather questions for the magazine interview, so that I could learn more about her and her life, in order to be able to create the best deliverables and branding system."}}}
