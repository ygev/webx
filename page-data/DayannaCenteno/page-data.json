The main character is \"Anre\", an adventurous sphere that changes colors (from magenta to white) while feeling anxious and relaxed. The purpose of creating two different environments is to make the player travel from facing fear and tension to later arrived in a calm and peaceful environment. The goal of \"Anxiety Survival\" is to motivate the players to take the first step in finding relaxation techniques in their daily life. We all face anxiety every day, this video game will give you the push. Try it!\n\n\n\n","projectProcess":"My project’s goal and ideas evolved day by day. My original idea was to showcase a relaxed and stress-free environment. Visitors were going to discover different ways of relaxation by using all of their senses. I named my project: Easy on you: Relaxation therapy through the Senses. After my degree proposal, I challenged myself to create a motion-narrative that will introduce/ motivate/push you to discover and experience anxiety and relaxation at the same time. I gave a video game look to this motion narrative so that it can be played anytime you feel anxious. I named this video game: Anxiety Survival. I used colors and textures to communicate the relaxation and anxiety vibes to the video game’s player. \nTo create this motion narrative, I sketched storyboards, style-frames, and look for the right tune that would represent each level. I used Cinema 4D, Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects and Adobe Encoder, and as my design tools. Then, I designed a website where the video game will be displayed. Moreover, the name \"Anre\" (the main character) derives from the first two letters of the words: “anxious” and “relaxed”.Anre’s ultimate goal is to influence and motivate players to practice relaxation techniques in their daily life.
