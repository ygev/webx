","projectProcess":"I began this project to understand the history of the contributions of Chinese Americans to the graphic design field, with the greater desire to uncover a design aesthetic that emerged from Chinese American design practices. I eventually became interested in studying commercial signs in Chinatowns, narrowing down to the Chinatown that I grew up visiting in Philly. This research involved conducting photo research and interviewing a signmaker. The end product is a book that compiles my observations and 3D model signs which explain the visual principles of commercial signs.      "}}}
