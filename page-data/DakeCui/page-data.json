Dake observed his life, picked two kinds of products, and designed packages for them by applying some logic into the design process. Full project detail can be found on https://imm.sh/ ","projectProcess":"We cannot find out the size info if a circle stays by itself. However, if we put two different size circles with the first circle together, size differences are generated. This idea made me start to think about creating some patterns to show differences in a series of products. I selected two products, milk and masks. They are common and popular products now and are ideal for this project. I designed some patterns based on products' characteristics. After that, I created some variations to the original patterns. I also created a brand and a website to make this project more complete."}}}
