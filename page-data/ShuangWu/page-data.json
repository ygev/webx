It is an extension of my Museum of Pets project, which is in response to the museum's adoption service.","projectProcess":"Designing a unique UIUX project is always challenging. To make the app fun to use, visually attractive and user-centered is even harder. I was struggling to start, but after learning more about UIUX online and reading resources from my previous UIUX class, I began to have a systematic process toward my pet adoption and foster app. As I dive deeper into the field, this project is always under construction and will be further developed."}}}
