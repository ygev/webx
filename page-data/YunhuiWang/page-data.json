The purpose of this exhibition is to visualize emotions and show them in a 2D way. Every emotion is complex and multi-faceted, not a single happy or sad, it may be happy with a little excitement, sad with a little hope, so I don't want every graphic element to have a specific meaning. Everyone looks at emtions through a filter shaped by personal experience, and this filter is usually very different from other people. ","projectProcess":"I try to use different shapes and color combinations to show different emotions. I don't want people to feel a single emotion from my work. Emotions should be complex. In addition to the basic posters, I also wanted to design the exhibition place."}}}
