It is important to be able to read all the text that accompanies each image to gain full understanding of the project: https://kemills2408.wixsite.com/throughthefog. “Through the Fog” is a visual narrative of the United States' ongoing struggle with suicide. This complex and multi-faceted social issue does not have a one-size-fits-all solution. This understanding brought forth a series of abstract and data driven experiments that center around the feelings of uncertainty and hopelessness taking over the Nation. My project strives to inspire deeper thought by using common household items and natural elements as unconventional analogies.","projectProcess":"The process and my experience with this project were far from perfect. They were messy, and at times I felt I had too many disconnected elements. However, whenever I got lost I would remind myself that I wasn't striving for perfection, but sincerity. I was drawn to experimenting with different types of physical items. Matches, gloves, tissue paper, plants, tape, and string were some of the different elements used. I meshed these physical objects with various mediums: motion, abstract collage, coding, data visualization, and illustration. The process was all over the place; small experiments birthed from my interest in studying this subject from various points of view. The data from the National Hotline and the emotional aspect was what led my research the most. I talked to Hopkins researchers, created spreadsheets, and poured over numerous books and documents. Ultimately, I found the emotional aspect more intriguing than the data. In the end, I was overwhelmed with the difficulty and uncertainty of the project. I discovered there wasn't a perfect or a one-size-fits-all design solution. The solution was generally as murky as the problem. "}}}
