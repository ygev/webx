Using the authentic voices of people who experience anxiety and depression, Mood contrasts the societal outlook of mental disorders with the lived experience. This project informs its audience and creates community among those sufferingâ€”they are not alone. View the website and additional resources at https://zoeyruss.github.io/Mood/","projectProcess":"Moods kinetic identity system is the result of extensive research on anxiety, depression, and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). The logo forms a cube; each plane and letter form represents a stage from the CBT framework (feelings, thoughts, and behaviors). Each letterform is created in motion resulting in over over 2,000 possible logo combinations. Content from Mood is directly from anonymous surveys taken by people suffering from anxiety and depression. The motion graphics translate the survey responses into a visual expression of anxiety and depression. A big breakthrough in the process came after creating a series of posters; I began to question their purpose, placement, and how they could be translated to conceptualize anxiety and depression by visually expressing how it feels to wear your emotions. These questions brought me to explore augmented reality. The end result of all of these explorations is a website. The website aims to create a community where people learn about anxiety and depression through visual explorations and for those suffering to see they are not alone.   "}}}
