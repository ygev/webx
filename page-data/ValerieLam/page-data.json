The game of mahjong has been pivotal in the development, and is the central theme of the project as a medium of communication.","projectProcess":"Throughout the semester, I created a variety of work, experimenting with different ways to express feelings about my identity and upbringing. I created risograph prints, designed a patterned mural, read Sour Heart by Jenny Zhang, laser-cut mahjong earrings, and conducted research on the history of mahjong before coming to the realization that mahjong has been a recurrent theme in my work. To me, the game has been a favorite pastime and more importantly, a medium of communication. "}}}
