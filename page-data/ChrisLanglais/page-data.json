","projectProcess":"I began this project with research on documented associations\nbetween vision and other senses. Using the research, I developed lettering with forms based on associations with the subject. The idea was to convey the object through the form and composition of the letters instead of just reading the word. I developed new posters and augmented the existing posters based on the feedback I received. During the process, I was encouraged to restrict my design to just visual elements and not include lettering. I developed new compositions, that were literal at first and through critiques I altered the designs to become more abstract. I finished this project with pieces created throughout the semester that will serve as an additional foundation to create projects on."}}}
