These terms have not only angered Asian-American leaders, but have led to an increase in hate crimes and xenophobic attacks targeting the Asian American community. Incidents include being told rude remarks to go back to China, blamed for being the origin of the virus, and being physically assaulted due to the spread of misinformation. Social media campaigns have launched, online incident reports have been created and hotlines have been implemented by local governments to combat racism and xenophobia. \n \nThis research-driven project includes extensive analysis on the origins of the coronavirus, referencing statistical studies of discrimination towards Asian-Americans, screenshots of social media posts related to misinformation about COVID-19, and personal responses from interviews of what it is like to be Asian-American amid this global pandemic.\n\t\nMy work explores how cultural identity impacts one to question their origins, both from a cultural and political viewpoint. I hope that this project empowers the Asian-American community to share their stories and speak out against racial injustice.","projectProcess":"The first part of my senior thesis, Navigating Chinese America, explores how Chinese American adoptees recognize their own identities if they see themselves as more “American” or more “Chinese.” My work explores the meaning of stereotypical, derogatory, and racist remarks through a variety of mediums and short term projects. To explore my ideas, I researched the history of Chinese in the Americas and the stereotypes surrounding Asian American culture. I created a series of two-week experimental projects exploring cultural appropriation, international adoption, and the model minority myth. The final body of work uncovers the narrative of a Chinese-American transracial adoptee, Baixue Yang, born under China’s one-child policy and the internal struggles she faced while exploring her ethnic identity.\n \nFor the second part of my thesis, I Am Chinese American. I Am Not the Origin of COVID-19, I \ncreated a body of work in response to the increase of racist and xenophobic attacks since the start of the coronavirus global pandemic. I conducted extensive research, read countless articles, studied online hate crime attack forms, analyzed the trends of misinformation from Twitter tweets, and created visual responses in reaction to the social media campaign #HateIsAVirus. My commentary takes two American inventions, caution tape and fortune cookies, and recontextualizes them in the age of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a Chinese American, I felt strongly about working with these two mediums to create a piece that brings awareness on how Trump's initial name for the coronavirus, “Chinese Virus” has negatively impacted the Asian American community as a whole and has acted as a catalyst for hostility and distaste towards them."}}}
