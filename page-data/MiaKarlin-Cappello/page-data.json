I am Not the Origin of COVID-19.","website":"https://miakarlincappello.com","instagram":"@miakarlincappello","projectSummary":"Following the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, President Donald Trump defended the use of the terms “Chinese Virus,” “China virus,” and ‘Kung-flu,’ ignoring backlash and claiming it is not racist at all. These terms have not only angered Chinese officials but have led to an increase in hate crimes and xenophobic attacks targeting the Asian American community. Incidents included being told to go back to China, blamed for being the origin of the virus, and being physically assaulted due to the spread of misinformation. Social media campaigns have launched, online incident reports have been created and hotlines have been implemented by local governments to combat racism and xenophobia. \n\nThis research-driven project includes extensive research on the origins of the coronavirus, referencing statistical studies of discrimination towards Asian-Americans, conducting interviews and compiling screenshots of social media posts about misinformation about the COVID-19 and personal responses of what it is like to be Chinese American amid this global pandemic.\n\nMy work explores how cultural Identity impacts one to question their origins, both from a cultural and political viewpoint. Combatting racism stems from ignorance. I hope that this project empowers the Asian American community to share their stories and speak out against racial injustice.\n","projectProcess":"Part I - Navigating Chinese America\n\nThe first part of my senior thesis, Navigating Chinese America, explores how Chinese American adoptees recognize their own identities If they see themselves as more “American” or more “Chinese.” My work explores the meaning of stereotypical, derogatory, and racist remarks through a variety of mediums and short term projects. To explore my ideas, I researched the history of Chinese in the Americas and the stereotypes surrounding Asian American culture. I created a series of two-week experimental projects exploring cultural appropriation, international adoption, and the model minority myth. The final body of work uncovers the narrative of a Chinese-American transracial adoptee, Baixue Yang, born under China’s one-child policy and the internal struggles she faced while exploring her ethnic identity. \n\nPart II - Asian American Racism amid COVID-19\n\nIn the second part of my thesis, I created a body of work in response to the increase of racist and xenophobic attacks since the start of the coronavirus global pandemic. I conducted extensive research, read countless articles, studied online hate crime attack forms, analyzed the trends of misinformation in tweets, and created visual responses in response to social media campaign #Hate Is A Virus. My commentary takes two uniquely American creations, caution tape, and fortune cookies, and recontextualizes them in the age of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a Chinese American, I felt strongly about working with these two mediums to create a piece that brings awareness on how Trump's initial name for the coronavirus, “Chinese Virus” have not only negatively impacted the Asian American population, but have contributed to the decline in America's Chinatowns.\n"}}}
