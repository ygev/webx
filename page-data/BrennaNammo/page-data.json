You will find in the following pages, not only my soul, but my body, my mind, and my struggle. It emanates from a love hate relationship with my body. It emanates from countless hours weeping in dressing rooms, avoiding mirrors, and chasing a body I’d never outrun. I know that my body and I have to live with each other. I hope you find some solace in these pages, and relate, either for yourself or someone you love. I know I am not alone in this. Thank you for allowing me to share this piece of me with you.","projectProcess":"I actually came up with this idea during a therapy session. I was talking to my therapist about how I hate clothes shopping because I hate dressing rooms, and this came to me. I knew I wanted to make a book for my degree project, and I later decided I wanted to write my own thoughts, poems, experiences, etc. for the content, as well as take accompanying pictures. After finishing the writing and the photos, I realized it needed one more thing to really make it successful, so I did a bunch of drawings for the cover and the inside. Seeing my book in its final form makes me appreciate all the hard work that went into this and I am so happy to finally be able to share it with you."}}}
