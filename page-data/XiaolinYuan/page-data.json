The project is built up by several small projects exploring around the theme of Feng Shui, the Chinese superstitious geomancy on harmonizing individuals with the universe. ","projectProcess":"The project contains three phases: phase one is to research and understand fully about superstition, its origin and history, defending against the common negative stereotype; phase two is finding self-identity through visual experiments on the ancient wisdom about the fundamental of the reality; phase three is the output, a series of visual assets on different aspects of Chinese superstitions, from the basic information to applications, focusing on translating the traditions into the contemporary design language.
