I had limited space so I decided to use a small canopy tent as the room and build a door for it that looks like a book. Next I had to think of what book and world my audience would be walking into. This was tough. There are just so many great books. So I came up with a theme instead and that was water. Water World would be a collection of poems and quoted book scenes having to do with water.\n\nI then broke up my weeks focusing on one section at a time. The inside of the tent was planned first, next the book door, then the outside of the tent. Each part was approached in a similar way. Researching and getting inspiration then sketching out ideas and making many lists. After gathering all the materials the building and setting up began.

In my project, I wanted to visualize music to recreate the small universe I imagined while listening to the music. I took one clip from each of the two songs and tried to transfer the feelings from my motion graphics. The graphics in my videos represent the mood I felt in my perspective. The relaxing and lazy atmosphere is transformed into a soft, dreamy, dizzy, and retro grainy style. This is my understanding reacted to these two clips of music. Of course, different people would have a different experience when listening to the same pieces of music. So I made these motion graphics to translate this abstract feeling expressively. The original purpose of my project was to learn and practice skills of After Effect and Cinema 4D software. Through the progress of my project, I felt I am now much confident with the softwares.

Facing various social influences and temptations, most people gradually fall into the trap of oversimplification. People's minds are affected by vision, and the limitations of vision also counteract our thinking patterns. For instance, high-power cultures often appropriate culture fragments from low-power people, which results in incomplete information transmission. So recognizing the limitations of vision is relevant to us. A singular sight should not measure the hidden nature and illusions. I hope to state a learning view that guides people to realize the value of establishing a multi-dimensional thinking mode. My project explores how to use visual information to understand objects based on the timeline, trend, and context rather than just the matter itself.",

By comparing the ways and characteristics of these drawings of basic graphics, I understand that culture has an impact on the way people draw, and education can affect people's vision. This opinion leads me to a debate about the interaction between vision and thinking patterns. I realized that judging the nature and appearance of things should not be measured by a limited and standardized attitude. The education system like a production assembly-line makes people lack the capacity to appreciate the unique individuality. We often see incidents of cultural appropriation in the fashion industry, which makes me recognize that the transmission of information should not be exacerbated by fragmentation and distortion. Then I began to think about how to make people aware of the importance of multidimensional perspectives. Inspired by Kurt Vonnegut's book, slaughterhouse-five, I applied the perspective of four-dimensional creatures to our space. I proposed a learning view on how to use visual information to understand objects based on timeline, development trend, overall environment rather than just the object itself under single cognition.\n",

        "writeASummaryOfTheProcessOfYourProject": "This project began with me searching for a way to process my emotions and experiences. I consider myself a private person and have difficulties opening up and being vulnerable. I choose to internalize most things, letting them run through-n-through my head till the tension is released unintentionally often in the worst ways. I could no longer do this to myself and others. Why couldn’t I be honest? What was I afraid of?\n\nAs a way to process and manage a deep depression I started writing. This was the easiest way to release all the things I felt, the things I needed to say. When I started writing at this point in my life it saved me. Sometimes it was the only way I could get out of bed. Even if nobody was to ever see what I had to say it was released from my mind and body. As I started creating work I was interested in art therapy practices and what they fulfilled. I researched into some techniques and found that the way I was working fell into the “Person Centered” realm. Person centered expressive art therapy allows a person to express themselves without guidance from their therapist. They simply choose to create or not and reflection comes through sharing the piece at the end of the session. Throughout all the readings I did with art therapy and personal experiences sharing continued to be a main focus. Sharing allows us to connect with others. It removes us from a constructed isolation that we may put ourselves in. As alone as we might feel at times, we never truly are. Sharing creates a trade of information and this trade allows us to explore more about ourselves and the world around us. When we open up and share and listen with others we can create healing spaces. Sharing can encourage others to feel more vulnerable once they see that someone else has taken that first step.\n\nParties and clubs are spaces that I felt allowed me to get the release I needed even if it was momentarily. The over stimulation from sound, movement, intoxication, and social engagement moved me to a place were I felt uninhibited and truly free. The clubs are very social and offer exchanges both verbally and physically. Visual inspiration came from party and club flyers. I have always felt a sense of authenticity from DIY flyers and low-fi party/nightclub scenes. Flyers are used as promotion for an event and framing my personal expressions as such promotes finding the space to allow yourself to be vulnerable. \n\nThe visual thread of club flyers allowed me to experiment and push the way I approach form making. I did not hold myself to any standard or specific visual method. Collage had become one process that really excited me. I enjoyed the deconstruction of something once known and the layering that could hide or reveal. Other processes I engaged in was RISO printing. The RISO felt like it fulfilled a lot of the aspects I was searching for; allowing me to collage directly for the printing process, the lo-fi appeal to DIY/club culture, and a way to quickly duplicate for distribution and sharing.\n\nThe final exhibition consisted of a newsprint poster series, a small publication as well as  a motion graphic. While the visual approach to all was not the same, they all started with writing. I did not do much planning for any design as I wanted them to feel honest to the moment they were created and the development that happened through experimenting. I hadn’t had a “personal” practice since before I started studying design. The personal never really had a place in design for me. I would use it to create platforms and encourage others to put themselves out there but I avoided the same encouragement for myself. The personal and emotional belong in design. Sharing ourselves as humans is important not just for ourselves, but for those around us. We all have stories and experiences, we all feel deeply, and we are all not alone in this world. Reflecting on this project I have seen growth in myself both personally and in my design practice. It is hard to be vulnerable but it’s those honest connections that allows us to grow together. This project has influenced where I see my independent practice going. I want to continue to share myself for the sake of my own healing, and the sake of others. I want to promote others to do the same. The personal is universal and it is important that we find the space for honest vulnerable connections. We are all human and we can all support each other.",

But even so, the lights and high-rise buildings that represent modern civilization are still gradually confining the world to an increasingly narrow sky. People live in the city and relish the material enjoyment at the expense of pollution. What does light pollution cost us? I hope to amplify the empathy point between humans and nature to motivate people's attention to light pollution, reflection on unconscious destruction, and awe of darkness/nature.",
        "writeASummaryOfTheProcessOfYourProject": "The most significant obstacle to solving a problem is that people sometimes lack awareness and attention to this problem. Therefore, I started with the most common things in people's lives - lights, shadows, and plants. For three weeks in a row, I went out every night between 12 and 2 am to photograph the objects around the place: reflective street signs, tree shadows on the road, flashbulbs by the apartment, traffic lights reflected by glass windows, etc. While taking photos, I tried to overexpose the images as much as possible. After this, I added histogram images on each picture, implying the abnormal states of those objects and also an abstract symbolization of cities.\nThe moment when people are most affected is when they resonate. Sometimes emotion-based expressions are more persuasive than straightforward narration. Based on the experience of being in the dark for the past three weeks, I designed another book of poetry - \"City's Victory Over Night.\" It collects a series of poems about the night from all over the world. In order to enable readers to better involve and feel, poetry collections are not limited by the size and style of the paper. I hope that the deliverables can convey the connection between night and people so that people and people's awe of darkness and nature.",

        "writeASummaryOfTheProcessOfYourProject": "Although some aspects are not up to my expectations, I am quite satisfied. For me, the project is not over, it will continue. It is not so much the final result, but what I gained in the design process.The first is to learn to think and design independently and enjoy the design process. The design process is contradictory, suspicious, surprising, happy... all the complex emotions rolled together. The experience of the design process is unique to the designer. This is that the process is often much richer than the experience brought to me by the result. In the end, what the public sees is the result. Even if the designer spreads out the process, it is difficult to convey the emotion and feeling that the designer gained during the process. So the design of pleasure or pain all belongs to the treasure of the designer.The second is to learn to give design time. Good design takes time to develop. Don't try to achieve your goals in one second or even one minute. From the inspiration to the final output, it takes time to study, think, and design. You may not find the right direction, clear goals, or even visualize your idea. But you have to push yourself, research, ask yourself questions, be patient. When it’s time, a lot of things will come naturally, and you may even get a surprise that you didn't expect before. In the documentary Life Is Fruity, grandmother Eiko said that Shuichi often told her to do what she could do slowly but firmly, and she did so and gained a lot. Finally, when I look back on the whole process of design, I am happy. I not only get a thesis design, but also feel my growth and change.",

I took 6 of the more famous cryptids (Mothman, Bigfoot, The Loch Ness Monster, Aliens, The Kraken, and Nightcrawlers) and made them into a sociable friend group that partake in things that many of us do today, like social media, astrology, hobbies, etc. The result is a booklet that is theoretically made and written by these creatures, meant to be read by humans in hopes of resolving mankind's lasting desire for understanding/discovering these beings.

I initially started drafting some of the characters in a more detailed and sketchy looking comic style, but because of possible time restrictions and considering the body text that I would have to write too, I revised the characters into these simple nebulous/amorphous shapes that have more design flexibility and are a more contemporary approach to cryptid/creature art. The shapes, along with the gentle and pastel color palettes I chose were meant to reflect the newfound friendliness I applied to the creatures, while also indicating the fact that the existence of them is ultimately open-ended and nothing about them is defined.

It plays such an important role in our brain. Different smells can bring you back to distant memories, change our emotions, and even help you connect with those you love. Therefore, when we experience a scent that is stored in our memory, our brain tends to associate it with certain memories, and the emotions involved with them. The way SniffSniff's operating is to shop, to create, to share the most unique and memorable scents in people’s minds. When shopping for a particular scent at the store, you can also get the personal memories/stories behind it. There are 6 Basic Emotional Reactions to Scent due to study.

Their answer helps me to build up my ideas to start designing everything. I start with the logo design as my first step. With the continuous improvement, after getting the final version of the logo, I moved to work on the packaging illustration of the scents bottle. Since the store is an ideal one, I decided to create the scents bottle as a graphic illustration instead of a real bottle mockup.

Self care has strayed from its roots in feminism, activism, and preserving identity to a mass market, exhausted neologism for privileged leisure.. By contrasting commodified objects of self care with statements of political, economic, and social issues, I intend to bring attention to the flaws in capitalist culture.

I gathered articles, read research studies, did mind-mapping, sketches, and created lists. My project evolved through learning and gathering differing viewpoints. Initially, I was focused on critiquing the commodification of self care and how it has become just another thing to do and post on social media. By working on this project over a few months, my thesis matured and I focused more on accessibility of care, inequality, and intersectionality. My initial project plan was to create digital posters overlayed with health statistics in a custom lettered font. That concept was short lived, and I quickly switched to a printmaking based approach. I designed a series of riso prints, contrasting statements of inequality with commodified objects of self care. The printing was simple; I took care to write statements that point out the obvious, in a slightly satirical way. Through this project I learned screenprinting and I utilized the technique to create hand lettered, illustrative prints with broad statements about self care culture, such as “spending money is not self care.” These prints are not included in my final series because I wanted to focus on issues of intersectionality and accessibility. I intend to continue learning about these topics, and allow them to guide and inform my future projects.",

        "writeASummaryOfYourProject": "As a multidisciplinary designer, the main motif within my practice is material exploration. Pushing the boundaries of graphic design and what that can look like in an institutional setting and beyond is what keeps me creating. Recently, material exploration, specifically industrial materials, has been something I have been very interested in exploring and in doing so, I am thinking about the relationship between industrial materials and people of color. Immigrants coming to the states often times make their living through blue collar jobs such as fabrication. This is where the line between practical usage of industrial materials and utilization of the same materials for fine art are blurred.\n\nGrowing up I was constantly surrounded by industrial materials such as wood and metal since my father built his life in the U.S by working as a fabricator. They are very special to me and they’re a huge part of what has formed my life and my fathers. It’s the thing that bonds us together- my interest in metal and his skill level in welding and fabrication.  Working these blue collar jobs is a  norm for immigrants coming into this country. They are seen as an easy Segway into achieving the “American Dream.” Within Can the Subaltern Speak, I am using metal signage to pay homage to him and to the thing that has shaped him as an immigrant. I created four silk flags that were designed by me but fabricated in India, to nod at the powerful symbolism they represent in this country. The flags are designed in Hindi and Spanish, turning the concept of American nationalism on its head as well as speaking more towards the concept of third culture. \n\nThird Culture kids are defined as people raised in a culture other than that of their country of nationality for a significant part of their early development years. They are often exposed to a greater variety of cultural influences. I wanted to explore this definition in order to make others aware of what this was.  I am sure a lot of people are unaware of third culture although they have been living in it their whole lives. I think it is important for others to feel whole while in this constant search of trying to find somewhere to fit in. My whole life the struggle has been that I am not  “American”enough, after all I don’t look  like an “American,” but we can get into that conversation later. I didn’t feel Indian enough nor did I feel Latin enough to claim those identities. I am not concretely one thing and that leaves a sour taste in my mouth, for the sake of wanting to be concretely whole. \n\n\nI have realized that although I am not concretely one thing, who is anyway? I am a mix of all my experiences. A fluid blend of everything I’ve gone through in my life, all the stares, remarks, and comments resulting in one unique being. This idea of third culture is a term that\n\nI myself recently found out about and it perfectly encapsulated what I have been\ntrying to put into words for years. It only made sense to me to mix different materials when creating a body of work surrounding an idea that is a mix of different cultures and experiences, to me, it was the rational decision to approach this topic in a multidisciplinary way. The pieces seen here that are made out of steel will be given back to my fathers shop once this installation is over to be used for further fabrication projects.\n",

This complex and multi-faceted social issue does not have a one-size-fits-all solution. This understanding brought forth a series of abstract and data driven experiments that center around the feelings of uncertainty and hopelessness taking over the Nation. My project strives to inspire deeper thought by using common household items and natural elements as unconventional analogies.",
        "writeASummaryOfTheProcessOfYourProject": "The process and my experience with this project were far from perfect. They were messy, and at times I felt I had too many disconnected elements. However, whenever I got lost I would remind myself that I wasn't striving for perfection, but sincerity. I was drawn to experimenting with different types of physical items. Matches, gloves, tissue paper, plants, tape, and string were some of the different elements used. I meshed these physical objects with various mediums: motion, abstract collage, coding, data visualization, and illustration. The process was all over the place; small experiments birthed from my interest in studying this subject from various points of view. The data from the National Hotline and the emotional aspect was what led my research the most. I talked to Hopkins researchers, created spreadsheets, and poured over numerous books and documents. Ultimately, I found the emotional aspect more intriguing than the data. In the end, I was overwhelmed with the difficulty and uncertainty of the project. I discovered there wasn't a perfect or a one-size-fits-all design solution. The solution was generally as murky as the problem. ",

Visitors were going to discover different ways of relaxation by using all of their senses. I named my project: Easy on you: Relaxation therapy through the Senses. After my degree proposal, I challenged myself to create a motion-narrative that will introduce/ motivate/push you to discover and experience anxiety and relaxation at the same time. I gave a video game look to this motion narrative so that it can be played anytime you feel anxious. I named this video game: Anxiety Survival. I used colors and textures to communicate the relaxation and anxiety vibes to the video game’s player. \nTo create this motion narrative, I sketched storyboards, style-frames, and look for the right tune that would represent each level. I used Cinema 4D, Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects and Adobe Encoder, and as my design tools. Then, I designed a website where the video game will be displayed. Moreover, the name \"Anre\" (the main character) derives from the first two letters of the words: “anxious” and “relaxed”.Anre’s ultimate goal is to influence and motivate players to practice relaxation techniques in their daily life.

        "writeASummaryOfYourProject": "Following the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, President Donald Trump defended the use of the terms: “Chinese Virus,” “China virus,” and “Kung-flu”, ignored backlash, and claimed that it was not racist at all. These terms have not only angered Asian-American leaders, but have led to an increase in hate crimes and xenophobic attacks targeting the Asian American community. Incidents include being told rude remarks to go back to China, blamed for being the origin of the virus, and being physically assaulted due to the spread of misinformation. Social media campaigns have launched, online incident reports have been created and hotlines have been implemented by local governments to combat racism and xenophobia. \n \nThis research-driven project includes extensive analysis on the origins of the coronavirus, referencing statistical studies of discrimination towards Asian-Americans, screenshots of social media posts related to misinformation about COVID-19, and personal responses from interviews of what it is like to be Asian-American amid this global pandemic.\n\t\nMy work explores how cultural identity impacts one to question their origins, both from a cultural and political viewpoint. I hope that this project empowers the Asian-American community to share their stories and speak out against racial injustice.",
        "writeASummaryOfTheProcessOfYourProject": "The first part of my senior thesis, Navigating Chinese America, explores how Chinese American adoptees recognize their own identities if they see themselves as more “American” or more “Chinese.” My work explores the meaning of stereotypical, derogatory, and racist remarks through a variety of mediums and short term projects. To explore my ideas, I researched the history of Chinese in the Americas and the stereotypes surrounding Asian American culture. I created a series of two-week experimental projects exploring cultural appropriation, international adoption, and the model minority myth. The final body of work uncovers the narrative of a Chinese-American transracial adoptee, Baixue Yang, born under China’s one-child policy and the internal struggles she faced while exploring her ethnic identity.\n \nFor the second part of my thesis, I Am Chinese American. I Am Not the Origin of COVID-19, I \ncreated a body of work in response to the increase of racist and xenophobic attacks since the start of the coronavirus global pandemic. I conducted extensive research, read countless articles, studied online hate crime attack forms, analyzed the trends of misinformation from Twitter tweets, and created visual responses in reaction to the social media campaign #HateIsAVirus. My commentary takes two American inventions, caution tape and fortune cookies, and recontextualizes them in the age of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a Chinese American, I felt strongly about working with these two mediums to create a piece that brings awareness on how Trump's initial name for the coronavirus, “Chinese Virus” has negatively impacted the Asian American community as a whole and has acted as a catalyst for hostility and distaste towards them.",
